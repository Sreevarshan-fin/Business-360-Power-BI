## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware is an India-based company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals to multiple retail and distributor channels across the country.
As the business expanded geographically, senior leadership struggled to maintain clear visibility into sales performance, profitability, and operational efficiency across regions.

This project focuses on building a centralized **Business 360 dashboard** that enables leadership to monitor performance across Finance, Sales, Supply Chain, Marketing, and Executive views using Power BI.

The objective was to replace fragmented, verbal reporting with a single source of truth that supports data-driven decision-making.

## Business Problem

The Sales Director relied heavily on verbal updates from regional managers (North, South, and Central India) to understand business performance.
Although overall sales were declining, there was no clear, data-backed explanation for why this was happening or where corrective action was required.

Key challenges included:

* Lack of real-time visibility into sales and profitability
* No standardized KPIs across regions and departments
* Manual data gathering consuming significant business time
* Difficulty validating regional performance claims with factual data

Leadership required a simple, reliable, and always-available visualization tool to clearly understand business performance and take timely action.
